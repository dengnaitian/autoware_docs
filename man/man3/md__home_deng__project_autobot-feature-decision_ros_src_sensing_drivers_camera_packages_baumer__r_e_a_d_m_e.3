ParameterTypeDescription  \fCfps\fP*Integer* Frames per second to try to acquire the image stream\&. \fCscale\fP*Double*Number between 0\&.1 and 1\&.0, the scaling factor for the output image\&. \fCbrightness\fP*Double*Number between 0\&.1 and 1\&.0, the brightness threshold to trigger exposure compensation\&. The camera does not have automatic exposure parametrization, therefore a naive Histogram compensation algorithm was added\&. \fCCalibrationFile\fP*String*Path to an Autoware compatible calibration file to be published in the \fCcamera_info\fP topic related to this camera\&.
