.PP
points_map_filter_node subscribe pointcloud maps and current pose, the node extract pointcloud near to the current pose\&.
.PP
.SS "subscribed topics"
.PP
/points_map (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2) : Raw pointcloud map\&. This topic usually comes from points_map_loader\&. /current_pose (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped) : Current pose of the car\&. This topic usually comes from pose_relay node\&.
.PP
.SS "published topics"
.PP
/points_map/filtered (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2) : Filtered pointcloud submap\&.
.PP
.SS "parameters"
.PP
load_grid_size (double) : grid size of submap\&. load_trigger_distance (double) : if the car moves load_trigger_distance(m), the map filter publish filtered submap\&.
.PP
.SS "how it works"
.PP
map_filter_node relay /points_map topic until it recieves /current_pose topic\&. Then, the /current_pose topic recieved, the map_filter_node publish submap\&.
